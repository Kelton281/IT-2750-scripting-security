#In chapter 3 we covered diffrent methods of encrpytion and decrpytion. Transition ciphers is a method were the message is divided into two groups of characters. one of them being even-numbered characters, while the other is odd-numbered characters. an other method is a subsittuion cipher where the orginal text in a encrpyted message is subsituited with other characters when the data is in transit. The remaining method of encrpytion is the Vignere cipher . This cipher uses a diffrent key for each letter to heightend security for the encrpyted message. This creates a larger skill gap for a hacker to tamper with the message when it's in transit
# Three basic string methods are astring.center(returns a string with sorrounding spaces), astring.count(returns numbers of occrences in string),astring.upper(returns string in all upercase format)
