#In chapter 6 we covered the RGB model used for digital processing and examined diffrences in a Pixel object, ImageWin object, file image object and a empty image object. a imagewin object constructs window that provides a title with set boundries of width and height.A file image object is compiled from files processed through digital camreas or one's diggital images within web pages.Empty image objects are for building new images with the pixel starting at value 0 in three dimensions. In chapter 7 we've coverd data mining and it's intended purposes for computing statisticals measurements. we covered how cluster analysis that will split data into meanining full groups to show similarities to outside groups. we explored an algorithim of K-means decides on how many clusters you want to create , and associate the numeric value to K. randomly select k out of the data points to pinpoint centroids for the clusters linked to K.
