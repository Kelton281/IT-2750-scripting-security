#In chapter 7 we've learned about the diffrent techniques used in data mining to note pattrens in data. These techniques can be used in marketing or bussiness analytics , and even discovering network trends. common techniques used in data mining are cluster analysis that divides data into meaningful groups by showing similarities to other groups , and show anomalies in data. Another data mining technique is K-means cluster analysis algoritm by associating the letter k with as many clusters you want to implement. data visualization can also be used in data mining to pin point trends in geographic locations. In chapter 8 we've covered crpytoanlysis which is  the processs of breaking down a algorithm that has a secret message. This chapter explains brute force techniques that trie's all possiblites in code to break a cipher. One of them are the rail fence cipher which stores a messages from top to bottom and left to right. In a rail fence cipher. The book recommends double checking your rail fence cipher by using a dictionary. The chapter 8 covered means of cracking a subsitituion cipher , which is noticing trends of english language in substitution cipher by finding common letters in the code.
